## RADIO Framework

A structured approach to answering system design questions:

1. **Requirements exploration**: Understand the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking clarifying questions.
2. **Architecture / High-level design**: Identify the key components of the product and how they are related to each other.
3. **Data model**: Describe the various data entities, the fields they contain, and which component(s) they belong to.
4. **Interface definition (API)**: Define the interface (API) between components, the functionality of each API, their parameters, and responses.
5. **Optimizations and deep dive**: Discuss possible optimization opportunities and specific areas of interest when building the product.

## Evaluation Axes

Key areas interviewers use to evaluate your performance:

1. **Problem exploration**: Show understanding of the problem, ask clarifying questions, and gather sufficient requirements.
2. **Architecture**: Break down the problem into smaller independent parts, define their responsibilities, and explain how components work together.
3. **Technical proficiency**: Demonstrate knowledge of front end fundamentals (performance, networking, accessibility, i18n, security, etc.), relevant technologies, and APIs.
4. **Exploration and tradeoffs**: Suggest various approaches, explain pros and cons, and make recommendations.
5. **Product and UX sense**: Show consideration for user experience and decisions that make the product great.
6. **Communication and collaboration**: Convey ideas clearly, be receptive to feedback, and collaborate with the interviewer.

## Common Mistakes

Avoid these frequent pitfalls:

- Jumping into answering the question immediately without first asking questions and gathering requirements.
- Approaching the question in an unstructured manner, missing important areas.
- Insisting on only one solution or the "best" solution without considering tradeoffs.
- Remaining silent and only thinking in your head instead of communicating.
- Going down a rabbit hole and spending too much time on unimportant areas.
- Using buzzwords without being able to explain them.
