In our anxiety to secure a job, some of us might forget that joining a bad team might be worse than waiting it out for a good opportunity. An interview is in fact an invaluable opportunity for the candidate to speak to someone who actually works in the company and find out more about the practices there. A few key aspects you should evaluate about a job before joining:
- Will the work be interesting to you?
- Is there room for career growth?
- Are the teammates/your manager collaborative and easy to work with?

Good questions asked at the end of the interview help a candidate achieve two objectives: leave a good impression and help the candidate assess if the company is truly suitable for them.

This article provides a large list of useful questions you might ask to achieve this. Questions are organized by interviewer/interview round as well as objective.

## Screening Rounds with HR/Recruiters

The recruiter is usually not working directly in the team who is hiring you. Hence, it could be less insightful to ask questions about the team's day-to-day or on-the-ground situation. However, you could still find out information that recruiters would know, such as the candidate evaluation criteria or general company policies.

### Get to Know the Criteria the Hiring Team is Looking Out For

- **"What are the skills, characteristics or experiences that the team is looking for in an ideal candidate?"**
  - Invaluable for pinpointing the key criteria the team is prioritizing in hiring, allowing you to showcase those required skills, characteristics, or experiences in the next rounds.
- **"When is the anticipated starting date for this position?"**
  - Useful if you have a delayed start date, to avoid wasting their time and yours.

### Get to Know More About the Hiring Team

- **"Will I have the opportunity to meet my potential manager or colleagues during the interview process?"**
  - Helps you prepare relevant questions or conduct background checks beforehand.
- **"Can you tell me about the team I'll be working with directly, including who I will report to and the team's structure?"**
  - May provide insights on the structure or dynamics of the team.

### Get to Know More from the Company's Perspective

- **"What are the current goals that the company is focused on, and how does this team work to support hitting those goals?"**
  - Gives insights on the importance and position of the team within the company.

  - Useful for understanding company policies and culture.
- **"How frequently do employees make themselves available outside of working hours?"**

## Rounds with the Hiring Team/Team You Will Join

As a front end developer / web developer, rounds with the engineering team usually means rounds with the hiring team itself. Questions to ask in these rounds are highly critical in elucidating the experience you would likely get when you actually join the team.

- **"Can you show me examples of projects I'd be working on and the technologies I will use? Will I be maintaining projects or building from scratch?"**
- **"Can you describe a typical day or week for a developer in your team?" / "Can you walk me through the process of a typical project?"**
- **"What are some of the challenges you expect the person in this position to face?"**
- **"What does it look like during the busiest and toughest times for this role?"**
- **"Will there be opportunities for stretch assignments where I can learn and use new skills?"**

### Check if Your Potential Manager's Managerial Style is Appropriate for Your Growth

- **"What type of information is shared with employees? Is revenue, profits, expenses, salary ranges, etc. shared?"**
- **"Who will I report to? Can you tell me more about their style of supervision?"**

### Understand More About the Team Dynamics and Culture

## Rounds with Your Potential Manager

In these rounds, it is useful to take the chance to find out your manager's managerial style, the performance review process/criteria, as well as his/her expectations of the role (which could give you an idea of how well you might perform on the job):
- Can you tell me about the kind of supervision you provide?
- Thinking back to people you've seen do this work previously, what differentiated the ones who were good from the ones who were really great at it?
- What are you hoping this person will accomplish in their first six months and in their first year?
