## The Interviewer's Intention

Most interviewers ask this question with a single objective in mind â€” to understand more about you through your motivations to join the company. They want to know whether you were interested enough to do your research, or if there was a special reason that constituted a strong motivation from you.

Most candidates mention how the company/job/product interests them and then stop there. However, a job is a mutually beneficial agreement. To leave a deeper impression, also mention why your skills will be useful to the company and how you can contribute.

## Suggested Answer Structure

To succeed, there are 3 basic steps to build your answer:

### 1. It should take between 60 to 90 seconds

- Never take more than 60 to 90 seconds. Any longer might constitute a monologue. For reference, 1 min is around 15 statements.

### 2. Gather deep insights about the company/team/position gained from current/previous employees of the company

- Most candidates do not impress in the "why do you want to work in this company/team" question because they tend to answer it based on the company's public information, which may not necessarily be representative of the individual team or department's culture or situation.
- To stand out, strive to find insights specific to the team you are joining, and use that to justify your interest (and therefore fit).

#### Common avenues to get team-specific insights:

1. Gain more insights about the team's stack or practices from the job description. In some cases, there could be many details you could tap on.
2. Search up team members on LinkedIn and understand more about their individual work scope, past projects, backgrounds, and interests.
3. Search up team members on Blind or even Reddit (go as specific in your query as possible).
4. Ask the recruiters / hiring managers. Some companies will have you chat with the hiring managers to assess suitability even before any technical rounds are conducted. This is the best chance to ask questions about the team and role.

#### Useful questions you could ask:

- What are some of the unique challenges or learning opportunities that developers get on your team versus other companies?
- What are the kinds of projects I could expect to work on if I were to join your team?
- How does the way this team operates differ from other teams in the company?
- Does this team work closely with other teams? Which ones and how so?
- Can you walk me through the process of a typical project?

### 3. Briefly explain why joining this company/role/team is a strategic and logical step for your career

- Take the chance to cement the interviewer's impression of your passion for the field or the efforts you have made to build your expertise.

### 4. Explain what you bring to the table

- Explain how you can contribute to the company through your skills and experience, aim to be unique and memorable if possible.
