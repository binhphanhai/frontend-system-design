Understanding and avoiding common mistakes can greatly improve your performance in front end system design interviews. This section summarizes frequent pitfalls and provides practical advice to help you stand out.

## 1. Jumping into Answering the Question Immediately
- **Mistake:** Starting to answer without clarifying requirements or assumptions.
- **Advice:** Take time to gather requirements and ask clarifying questions. It's better to answer the right question poorly than the wrong question well.

## 2. Approaching the Question in an Unstructured Manner
- **Mistake:** Giving a messy, unorganized answer due to the open-ended nature of system design interviews.
- **Advice:** Use a structured framework like RADIO. Write down each step at the start and ensure you cover all sections. You can revisit sections as needed.

## 3. Insisting on Only One Solution or the "Best" Solution
- **Mistake:** Claiming there is only one right or best solution, or refusing to discuss alternatives.
- **Advice:** Recognize that most problems have multiple solutions, each with tradeoffs. Discuss alternatives, even if some are clearly suboptimal, and explain why.

## 4. Remaining Silent the Entire Time
- **Mistake:** Not communicating your thought process, thinking only in your head.
- **Advice:** Think out loud! Treat the interview as a collaborative exercise. Discuss issues, bounce ideas, and engage with your interviewer.

## 5. Going Down a Rabbit Hole
- **Mistake:** Spending too much time on a single component or detail.
- **Advice:** Start with a high-level design, then elaborate on important parts. If unsure, ask the interviewer where to focus. Avoid wasting time on less relevant details.

## 6. Using Buzzwords Without Being Able to Explain Them
- **Mistake:** Using technical terms or buzzwords you can't explain.
- **Advice:** Only use terms you understand well. Be prepared to explain any concept you mention, as interviewers may probe for deeper understanding.
