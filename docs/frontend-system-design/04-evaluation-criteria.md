# Evaluation Criteria for Front End System Design Interviews

Understanding what interviewers look for is key to excelling in front end system design interviews. This section summarizes the main evaluation axes and the behaviors that signal strong performance, mapped to the RADIO framework (Requirements, Architecture, Data model, Interface, Optimizations).

## What Interviewers Look For

Interviewers assess candidates based on specific behaviors and signals. The more desired behaviors you display, and the more detailed and mature your answers, the higher your chances of a strong hiring and leveling recommendation.

---

## 1. Problem Exploration
- Show thorough understanding of the problem.
- Ask clarifying questions to minimize ambiguities.
- Gather both functional and non-functional requirements.
- Define the scope and focus on important aspects.

**Relevant RADIO section:** Requirements exploration

---

## 2. Architecture
- Develop an architecture that solves the problem end-to-end.
- Break down the problem into independent, well-defined parts.
- Identify system components and clearly define their responsibilities.
- Explain how components interact and describe the APIs between them.
- Ensure the architecture is practical, scalable, reusable, and extensible.

**Relevant RADIO sections:** Architecture/High-level design, Data model, Interface definition

---

## 3. Technical Proficiency
- Demonstrate strong knowledge of front end fundamentals, technologies, and APIs.
- Dive into relevant front end domain areas (e.g., Performance, Networking, HTML/CSS, Accessibility, Internationalization, Security, Scalability).
- Identify and address areas needing special attention, proposing solutions and analyzing tradeoffs.

**Relevant RADIO sections:** Architecture/High-level design, Optimizations and deep dive

---

## 4. Exploration and Tradeoffs
- Offer multiple solutions to problems and explain the pros and cons of each.
- Discuss the suitability of solutions in context, providing recommendations.
- Acknowledge even obviously bad alternatives and explain why they are not chosen.

**Relevant RADIO sections:** Requirements exploration, Data model, Interface definition, Optimizations and deep dive

---

## 5. Product and UX Sense
- Propose robust solutions that lay the foundation for a good product.
- Consider user experience: loading states, performance, mobile/keyboard friendliness, etc.
- Anticipate error cases and suggest ways to handle them.

**Relevant RADIO section:** Optimizations and deep dive

---

## 6. Communication and Collaboration
- Communicate ideas clearly and concisely.
- Explain complex concepts with ease.
- Engage the interviewer, ask good questions, and seek feedback.
- Be open to feedback and refine your solutions accordingly.

**Relevant RADIO sections:** Architecture/High-level design, Data model, Interface definition, Optimizations and deep dive
