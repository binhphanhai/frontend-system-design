# 03-radio-framework: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Evaluate your ability to use a structured framework (RADIO) for frontend system design interviews.

Want to see:

- If you can break down problems using a repeatable process.
- If you cover all key aspects: Requirements, API, Data, Integration, Optimization.

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Use the RADIO framework**

   - R: Requirements – clarify functional and non-functional needs.
   - A: API – define interfaces, props, and contracts.
   - D: Data – plan state, data flow, and persistence.
   - I: Integration – connect with backend, services, or other components.
   - O: Optimization – address performance, scalability, and edge cases.

2. **Apply RADIO to any design problem**
   - Walk through each step for the given scenario.
   - Use it to structure your answer and cover all bases.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “For a file uploader, I’d clarify requirements (file types, size), design the API (props, events), plan state (upload progress), integrate with backend (API calls), and optimize for large files and errors.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t skip steps—use RADIO to ensure a complete answer.
- Practice applying the framework to different problems.
- Be ready to adapt RADIO to fit the question.
