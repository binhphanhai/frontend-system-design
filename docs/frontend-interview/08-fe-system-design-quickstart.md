## What Are Front End System Design Interviews?

System Design interviews can come in many forms and cover the entire development stack. GreatFrontEnd focuses on **Front End System Design**—that is, the system design and architecture of client applications and UI components, rather than back end distributed systems.

We have written a comprehensive [Front End System Design guide](/front-end-system-design-playbook) which you should definitely check out for in-depth preparation.

## Design Your System with Best Practices

When going about the system design interview, regardless of whether you are asked to design apps, games, or UI components, there are some things to pay special attention to. Incorporate the tips from our [User Interface Questions Cheatsheet](/front-end-interview-playbook/user-interface-questions-cheatsheet) and elevate your front end interview game.
