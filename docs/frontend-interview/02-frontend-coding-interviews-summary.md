# 02-frontend-coding-interviews: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Assess your ability to solve coding problems relevant to frontend development.

Want to see:

- If you can write clean, correct, and efficient code.
- How you approach debugging and edge cases.
- If you can explain your reasoning and communicate clearly.

---

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Understand the coding interview format**

   - Expect questions on JavaScript, algorithms, and data structures.
   - May include DOM manipulation, async code, or browser APIs.

2. **Approach each problem methodically**

   - Clarify requirements and constraints.
   - Plan your solution before coding.
   - Write code incrementally and test as you go.
   - Handle edge cases and optimize if time allows.

3. **Communicate throughout**
   - Explain your thought process and decisions.
   - Ask clarifying questions if needed.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “Given an array of numbers, I’d clarify if it’s sorted, if duplicates are allowed, and what output is expected. I’d outline my approach, write the code, and test with edge cases.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t jump into coding without a plan.
- Always check for edge cases and test your code.
- Practice coding by hand or in a plain editor to simulate interview conditions.
