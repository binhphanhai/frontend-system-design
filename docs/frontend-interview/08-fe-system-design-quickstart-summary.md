# 08-fe-system-design-quickstart: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Assess your ability to approach frontend system design problems methodically and communicate your thinking.

Want to see:

- If you can break down complex problems into manageable parts.
- How you prioritize requirements and make tradeoffs.
- If you can design scalable, maintainable solutions.

---

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Clarify requirements and constraints**

   - Ask about users, scale, performance, and edge cases.

2. **Break down the problem**

   - Identify core components, data flow, and interactions.
   - Sketch a high-level architecture (diagram if possible).

3. **Prioritize and justify decisions**

   - Explain tradeoffs (performance, maintainability, user experience).
   - Discuss how you’d handle scaling, errors, and future changes.

4. **Communicate clearly**
   - Walk through your design step by step.
   - Be open to feedback and alternative approaches.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “For a chat app, I’d break it into components (input, message list, user list), use WebSockets for real-time updates, and optimize rendering for large message volumes.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t jump into coding—start with requirements and architecture.
- Be explicit about tradeoffs and alternatives.
- Practice drawing and explaining diagrams.
