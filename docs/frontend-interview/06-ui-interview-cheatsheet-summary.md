**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Quickly assess your readiness and approach for UI coding interviews.

Want to see:

- If you know the key UI concepts and patterns.
- If you can apply best practices for accessibility, state, and performance.
- If you can reason about tradeoffs and communicate clearly.

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Review core UI interview topics**

   - Component structure, state management, props, events.
   - Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
   - Styling approaches (CSS, CSS-in-JS, frameworks).
   - Performance optimizations (memoization, virtualization).

2. **Prepare for common UI tasks**

   - Build and style components (button, modal, dropdown, list, etc.).
   - Handle edge cases and error states.
   - Test for accessibility and responsiveness.

3. **Communicate your approach**
   - Explain your design, code, and tradeoffs.
   - Discuss how you’d improve or refactor.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “For a modal, I’d manage open/close state, trap focus, handle escape key, and use ARIA roles. I’d style for responsiveness and test with screen readers.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t forget accessibility and edge cases.
- Keep code modular and reusable.
- Practice explaining your decisions out loud.
