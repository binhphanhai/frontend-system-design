# 03-javascript-coding-interviews: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Evaluate your mastery of JavaScript fundamentals and ability to solve real-world problems.

Want to see:

- If you understand core JS concepts (scope, closures, async, prototypes, etc.).
- If you can apply JS to solve practical problems.
- How you handle tricky or edge-case scenarios.

---

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Review core JavaScript topics**

   - Scope, closures, hoisting, this, prototypes, inheritance.
   - Async: callbacks, promises, async/await.
   - Array/object methods, functional programming basics.

2. **Practice common interview problems**

   - Implement debounce/throttle, deep clone, event delegation, etc.
   - Solve problems involving async code, data transformation, or DOM manipulation.

3. **Explain your reasoning and code**
   - Walk through your solution step by step.
   - Highlight tradeoffs and edge cases.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “To implement debounce, I’d use a timer variable and clearTimeout to delay function execution. I’d explain how this prevents rapid firing and improves performance.”

---

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t just memorize definitions—practice applying concepts.
- Be ready to explain why your solution works and how you’d improve it.
- Watch out for common JS pitfalls (e.g., variable hoisting, async bugs).
