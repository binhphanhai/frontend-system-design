# 07-ui-component-api-design: Summary

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Assess your ability to design flexible, robust, and user-friendly component APIs.

Want to see:

- If you can define clear, intuitive props and event contracts.
- How you handle extensibility, customization, and edge cases.
- If you can balance simplicity with flexibility.

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Define the component’s purpose and use cases**

   - What problem does it solve? Who will use it?

2. **Design the API**

   - List required and optional props.
   - Define event handlers and callback signatures.
   - Consider default values and sensible fallbacks.

3. **Plan for extensibility and customization**

   - Support custom rendering (render props, slots, children).
   - Allow style overrides and className.
   - Document edge cases and limitations.

4. **Communicate your design**
   - Explain tradeoffs and rationale for API choices.
   - Show how your API supports real-world scenarios.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “For a Button component, I’d accept props for type, disabled, onClick, children, and className. I’d support custom rendering for icons and loading states, and document all props and events.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t overcomplicate the API—start simple and add flexibility as needed.
- Always document your component’s usage and edge cases.
- Test your API with real use cases and consumers.
