# 04-data-structures-algorithms-interviews: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**
Goal: Assess your understanding of data structures and algorithms as they apply to frontend work.

Want to see:

- If you can choose and implement the right data structure for a problem.
- If you understand algorithmic complexity and tradeoffs.
- How you optimize for performance and readability.

---

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Review key data structures and algorithms**

   - Arrays, objects, sets, maps, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs.
   - Sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming.

2. **Practice applying them to frontend scenarios**

   - E.g., efficiently updating the DOM, managing state, handling large datasets.

3. **Explain your choices and optimizations**
   - Discuss time/space complexity and tradeoffs.
   - Justify why your approach fits the problem.

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

- “To efficiently render a large list, I’d use windowing/virtualization and a queue to manage visible items. I’d explain how this reduces DOM nodes and improves performance.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t just use the first data structure that comes to mind—think about the best fit.
- Always consider edge cases and performance.
- Practice explaining your reasoning clearly.
