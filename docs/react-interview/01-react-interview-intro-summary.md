✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Clarify Interview Scope**

   - Core React concepts (JSX, components, props, state, lifecycle)
   - Hooks, context, state management
   - Event handling, forms, data fetching
   - Performance, accessibility, testing
   - Patterns, anti-patterns, code review
   - Ecosystem: routing, styling, build tools

2. **Preparation Strategy**

   - Review React docs, official tutorials, and source code
   - Practice coding: implement components, hooks, forms, data fetching
   - Mock interviews, code reviews, whiteboard sessions
   - Study common patterns, anti-patterns, and best practices
   - Build a portfolio or contribute to open source

3. **Interview Process**

   - Phone screen: basic concepts, coding
   - Technical screen: live coding, debugging, code review
   - System design: component architecture, state/data flow
   - Onsite: deep dive, pair programming, culture fit

4. **Actionable Checklist**
   - Master core concepts and hooks
   - Practice with real-world scenarios (forms, data, state)
   - Review accessibility and performance
   - Prepare to explain tradeoffs and design decisions
   - Be ready for code review and refactoring questions
