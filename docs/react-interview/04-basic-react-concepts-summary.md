# 04-basic-react-concepts: Summary

**Interviewer’s Intention**  
Goal: Assess your understanding of React’s core concepts and your ability to apply them in real-world scenarios.

Want to see:

- If you can explain and use JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle.
- How you handle data flow, rendering, and updates.
- If you can break down concepts for others and apply them in code.

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Core Concepts**

   - JSX: syntax, expressions, transpilation
   - Components: function vs. class, composition, reusability
   - Props: passing data, defaultProps, propTypes
   - State: local state, setState/useState, immutability
   - Lifecycle: mounting, updating, unmounting, useEffect
   - Data flow: unidirectional, lifting state up

2. **Actionable Checklist**
   - Write and explain function/class components
   - Use props and state effectively
   - Understand and use lifecycle methods/hooks
   - Debug rendering and update issues
   - Practice with real-world examples (forms, lists, conditional rendering)

✅ **Example Content / Model Answer**

> “React’s core concepts are JSX, components, props, state, and lifecycle. I use function components and hooks for most cases, manage state immutably, and lift state up for shared data. I’m comfortable with the component lifecycle and can debug rendering issues. I practice by building forms, lists, and interactive UIs.”

**Pro Tips / Common Pitfalls**

- Don’t mutate state directly—always use setState/useState.
- Remember that props are read-only.
- Practice explaining concepts to others.
