# 10-signup-form-example: Summary

---

**Interviewer’s Intention**  
Goal: Assess your ability to build a robust, accessible signup form in React, handling validation and UX edge cases.

Want to see:

- If you can structure a form, manage state, and validate inputs.
- How you handle accessibility, error messages, and async flows.
- If you can explain tradeoffs and best practices.

✅ **Answer Framework**

1. **Form Structure**

   - Fields: name, email, password, confirm password, etc.
   - Controlled components for all fields
   - useState/useReducer for form state
   - Validation: required, email format, password strength, match

2. **Validation & Error Handling**

   - Validate on change/blur/submit
   - Show error messages, link to fields (aria-describedby)
   - Async validation (e.g., check if email is taken)
   - Accessibility: labels, ARIA, keyboard navigation

3. **UX & Edge Cases**

   - Loading indicators for async validation/submit
   - Disable submit when invalid/loading
   - Reset/clear form on success
   - Handle server errors gracefully

4. **Actionable Checklist**
   - Use controlled components and manage state
   - Validate and show errors accessibly
   - Test with keyboard and screen readers
   - Optimize for performance (debounce, memoize)
   - Handle async and server errors
