# Signup Form Example in React

_A step-by-step guide to building an accessible React signup form with uncontrolled inputs, proper labeling, browser validation, and client-side submission_

---

Building a form with great user experience and accessibility isn't all that easyâ€”but it also isn't that hard once you know the things to pay attention to.

This guide demonstrates the basics of building a good, accessible simple signup form with uncontrolled inputs. Since the inputs are uncontrolled, most of the points aren't specific to React, but are best practices for web forms in general.

## 1. Input Field

Start with an `<input>` field. `<input>` elements are the backbone of HTML forms and, depending on the `type` attribute value, browsers render these controls differently to assist the user in filling up the form. Common values include `text`, `email`, `number`, `url`, `checkbox`, `file`, etc.

```html
<input type="email" />
```

---

## 2. Add Label to Input Field

All `<input>` tags should have an associated `<label>` for accessibility purposes. This is necessary so that users of assistive technologies can tell what the input is for. Clicking or touching a label will also focus on the label's associated form control.

The `<label>` and the `<input>` are linked using `for` (`htmlFor` in React) and `id` attributes respectively.

```jsx
<label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
<input id="email-input" type="email" />
```

Alternatively, you can use `aria-label` on `<input>`, but it is better to have a visible label using `<label>`.

---

## 3. Wrap Within a Form

Next, the elements should be wrapped within a `<form>`. This enables the browser's enter-to-submit behavior, so users can hit Enter to submit the form.

```jsx
<form>
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input id="email-input" type="email" />
</form>
```

---

## 4. Form Attributes

The `<form>` tag accepts these attributes:

- `action`: Specifies the URL of the server that will receive the submitted form data.
- `method`: Defines the HTTP method used to send the form data. Common values are:
  - `POST`: Form data is sent as part of the request body.
  - `GET`: Form data is appended to the URL as search/query parameters.
- `enctype`: Specifies how the form data should be encoded when submitting it to the server. This is particularly important when you're uploading files.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input id="email-input" type="email" />
</form>
```

---

## 5. Submit Button

While not all users are aware they can hit Enter to submit the form, submit buttons are universally understood mechanisms for form submissions. If the `type` attribute of the `<button>` is not specified, the default value used is `<button type="submit">`.

When such `<button>`s are used within a `<form>`, triggering them will cause form submissions.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input id="email-input" type="email" />
  <button>Sign up</button>
</form>
```

An alternative way to create a submit button is by using the `<input>` tag with `type="submit"`.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input id="email-input" type="email" />
  <input type="submit" value="Sign up" />
</form>
```

---

## 6. Input Field `name` Attribute

`<input>` elements with a `name` attribute defined will be included in the form submission data as part of the name/value pairs.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input id="email-input" name="userEmail" type="email" />
  <button>Sign up</button>
</form>
```

With the `name` attribute specified, when the form is submitted:

- For `<form method="GET">`, a HTTP GET request will be made to `/users/signup?userEmail=john.doe@gmail.com`.
- For `<form method="POST">`, a HTTP POST request will be made to `/users/signup` with the body as `userEmail=john.doe@gmail.com`.

If there are more form fields, the key-value pairs are concatenated with `&` as the delimiter, e.g. `userEmail=john.doe@gmail.com&password=securepassword123`.

The value of an `<input>` element without a `name` attribute is not included in the data submitted to the server. The `name` attribute acts as a key for the form data, pairing it with the `value` attribute of the input element. If the `name` attribute is missing, the form data associated with that input will not be part of the HTTP request when the form is submitted.

**All form control input elements should have the `name` attribute specified.**

---

## 7. Other Attributes for Input Field (e.g. `autocomplete`)

By adding the `autocomplete` attribute, browsers will offer suggestions based on the value and the user's autofill data such as addresses and payment methods.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input autocomplete="email" id="email-input" name="userEmail" type="email" />
  <button>Sign up</button>
</form>
```

Possible values include `email`, `family-name`, `new-password`, `street-address`, etc. Refer to the [full list of values on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete#values). Specifying the `autocomplete` attribute is especially useful for shipping and billing address forms on checkout pages.

---

## 8. Browser Validation

Add a password field using `<input type="password" />`.

By specifying attributes like `required`, `minlength`, `pattern` on `<input>`, the browser can help to validate that the user's input matches these requirements before the form is submitted to the server.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input
    autocomplete="email"
    id="email-input"
    name="userEmail"
    required
    type="email"
  />
  <label htmlFor="password-input">Password</label>
  <input
    autocomplete="new-password"
    id="password-input"
    minlength="8"
    name="userPassword"
    required
    type="password"
  />
  <button>Sign up</button>
</form>
```

> **Note:** Browser validation alone is insufficient! Malicious personnel can directly hit your server endpoints without using your HTML form. You should still validate and sanitize all user input on the server.

## 9. Link Form Control Descriptions Using `aria-describedby`

For `<input>`s which benefit from additional descriptions or hint text, they can be associated with the element that contains the descriptive text, which could be a `<span>`, `<div>`, or any other suitable HTML element.

```html
<form method="POST" action="/users/signup">
  <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
  <input
    autocomplete="email"
    id="email-input"
    name="userEmail"
    required
    type="email"
  />
  <label htmlFor="password-input">Password</label>
  <input
    aria-describedby="password-hint"
    autocomplete="new-password"
    id="password-input"
    minlength="8"
    name="userPassword"
    required
    type="password"
  />
  <div id="password-hint">
    Your password must be at least 8 characters long.
  </div>
  <button>Sign up</button>
</form>
```

When a user focuses on the password input field, assistive technologies like screen readers will read the input label along with the additional instructions provided in the `<div>`. This helps users understand the requirements for the password field more clearly.

## 10. Submission via `fetch()`

The current form will make a HTTP POST request to `/users/signup` upon submission, which causes a full page navigation and that might not always be desirable.

We can modify the form to make a client-side HTTP POST request via `fetch()`. The main changes to make are:

- Call `event.preventDefault()` to prevent the browser from navigating away
- Use `new FormData(formElement)` to get the input fields data from the form element
- Send the data to the server API endpoint via `fetch()`

```jsx
function SignupForm() {
  async function handleSubmit(event) {
    // Prevent default behavior, which is a navigation
    event.preventDefault();
    const formElement = event.target;
    const formData = new FormData(formElement);
    const response = await fetch("/users/signup", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({
        email: formData.get("userEmail"),
        password: formData.get("userPassword"),
      }),
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    if (!response.ok) {
      // Handle error response
      return;
    }
    // Handle success flow
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label htmlFor="email-input">Email</label>
      <input
        autocomplete="email"
        id="email-input"
        name="userEmail"
        required
        type="email"
      />
      <label htmlFor="password-input">Password</label>
      <input
        aria-describedby="password-hint"
        autocomplete="new-password"
        id="password-input"
        minlength="8"
        name="userPassword"
        required
        type="password"
      />
      <div id="password-hint">
        Your password must be at least 8 characters long.
      </div>
      <button>Sign up</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

There you have it, a fully-accessible sign up form in React.
